# Linq-ProblemSolving-Puzzles    
****************** Inspired by Mark Heath ****************
Advent code challenge solved using C# LINQ


I will be using C# and Linq to solve this yearâ€™s Advent of Code challenges. 

The idea would be write pipeline methods and try and solve the problem in big linq expression. 

I would be using LINQPAD.

 LINQPad is a simple LINQ / SQL editing and executing environment and is great for learning LINQ. 
 It also doubles up as a lite version of SQL management studio, allowing you to easily run your LINQ or SQL statements.
 
 The Dump() method of Linqpad is divine. You can plug it in any of steps of your pipleline.
 The result pan of the Linqpad also is a great visual tool which renders your objects and datastructures in a grid or hierarchical fashion
 
 Extremely useful in day-to-day coding.
